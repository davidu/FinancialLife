# Description

FinancialLife is an opinionated framework written in Python that allows to simulate monetary flows between different types of accounts. These simulations allow a deeper understanding of financial plans and a better comparison of financial products (in particular loan conditions) for personal circumstances. With FinancialLife you can

* analyse loan conditions and payment strategies
* describe the properties of your financial plans with a few lines of code
* create dynamic monetary flows between accounts for modeling more realistic scenarios
* extend the code by controller functions (e.g. for modeling tax payments)

View [documentation](docs/README.md) for a more detailed introduction.

# Example
Say you want to model an account with regular income and payments to a loan

```python
from FinancialLife.financing import accounts as a
from datetime import timedelta, datetime

# create a private bank account and a loan account
account = a.Bank_Account(amount = 1000, interest = 0.001, name = 'Main account')
loan = a.Loan(amount = 100000, interest = 0.01, name = 'House Credit')

# add these accounts to the simulation
simulation = a.Simulation(account, loan)

# describe monetary flows between accounts
simulation.add_regular('Income', account, 2000, interval = 'monthly')
simulation.add_regular(account, loan, lambda: min(1500, -loan.account), interval = 'monthly')

# simulate for ten years
simulation.simulate(delta = timedelta(days=365*10))

# plot the data
simulation.plt_summary()

# print reports summarized by years
print(account.report.yearly())
print(loan.report.yearly())

# analyze data
print("Interests on bank account: %.2f" % sum(account.report.yearly().interest))
print("Interests on loan account: %.2f" % sum(loan.report.yearly().interest))
```  

The output will look like this:

Now let's say, we put some money on a special savings account with better interests, because we want to purchase in two years a car. With FinancialLife, you just add the necessary changes to your model.

```python
# create new account
savings = a.Bank_Account(amount = 5000, interest = 0.007, name = 'Savings')

# add it to the simulation (or create a new simulation with all three accounts)
simulation.add_account(savings)

# add regular payment to the savings-account
simulation.add_regular(account, savings, 500, interval = 'monthly')

# somewhere in the distant future we will make a payment to
# the vendor of a car
simulation.add_unique(savings, 'Vendor of a car', 10000, '17.03.2019')
```

The plot will now include the savings-account as well.

You can also export the simulation to HTML to explore your model in the browser:

```python
from FinancialLife.reports import html

html.report(simulation, style="standard", output_dir = result_folder)
```

<img src="docs/img/html_summary_01.png" alt="Simple simulation in FinancialLife" width="800" height="407">

You can analyse the reports as [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) DataFrame as well and export it to excel:

```python
import pandas as pd
from FinancialLife.reports import excel

account.report.as_df()    # Hello pandas
excel.report(simulation, filename='reports.xls')  # explore the results in excel

```

[Here](FinancialLife/examples/README.md) are more examples. FinancialLife supports:
* [dependencies between accounts](FinancialLife/examples/dependencies.py), e.g. to model how the ownership of a property rises when the loan decreases
* [meta-data](FinancialLife/examples/meta_data.md), e.g. for writing tax-calculations, which require additional knowledge about your payments
* [controller-functions](FinancialLife/examples/meta_data.md) for dynamic changes of the simulation properties during simulation

# Why FinancialLife

FinancialLife was designed with the idea in mind that any line of code should contribute to the description of the problem you want to model. In spreadsheets, you would deal with a lot of auxiliary tables to accurately calculate the course of a loan influenced by incoming payments and generated interests. In FinancialLife, you just create your loan account with the given interests rate and you define the regular payments going into this loan account. That's it. Changes in the model and the exploration of different parameters within this model are therefore way easier to accomplish than in a spreadsheet-based simulation.
